#Binary Classification (Pass or Fail) Analysis regarding Math grades

#The aim of this report is to have a possibly high interpretability level of a model with
#respect of the student math performance
#The interpretability level means that the plots have enough leaf nodes which helps to
#explain the variables


# The variable G3 helps to determine the binary level of pass and fail, 
#In addition, I am going to do three extras configurations:

#Configurations:
# A. With all variables except G3
# B. With all the variables except G3 and G2. 
# C. With all the variables except G3 and G1. 
# D. With all the variables except G3, G2 and G1.
